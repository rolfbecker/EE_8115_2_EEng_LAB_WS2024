# HSRW EE_8115_2_LAB: Electrical Engineering LAB

This git repository provides the **open educational resources (OER)** used in the 1st semester course of the [**Environment & Energy Program**](https://www.hochschule-rhein-waal.de/en/faculties/communication-and-environment/degree-programmes/bachelor-degree-programmes/environment-and) at [**Rhine-Waal University of Applied Sciences (HSRW)**](https://www.hsrw.eu/). The [**HSRW's Earth Observation Lab**](https://wiki.eolab.de/) is developing this course material. 

**These lab exercises are part of the course [EE_8115_2](https://github.com/rolfbecker/EE_8115_2_EEng_WS2024/).**

Go to **[EEng Lab Course Preparation](./EEng_LAB_Course_Preparation/README.md)** to set up your Python work environment based on **Jupyter Lab**.


## Lab Exercises ##

* [Exercise 1](ex1): Calibrate a CdS Photoresistor (aka Light Dependent Resistor ot Photocell). 
* [Exercise 2](ex2): Determine the capacitance of an unknown electrolytic capacitor.
* [Exercise 3](ex3): PV Module Performance and Partial Shading
